Whoah!
Straight out of 2003; here are the original sources for
Timur Lenk (winner, Amiga 4k at Breakpoint, "dest/" directory)
and Fistpig (5th, combined 4k at Assembly, "pig/" directory)
by Spaceballs and Ephidrena

Effects and intro design: Slummy/Spb
Synth and music: Loaderror/Eph

Tiny c2p: SP/Contraz
Sinus generator: Azure/Artwork


The sources compile (and were developed) in AsmOne v1.30 with the "Label :" 
and "; Comment" options switched off.
The intros used Azure's 4k cruncher (not included) from the Wave/Dawn2 source 
package to crunch everything between the "_codeStart" and "_codeEnd" variables.
However, assembling the sources as-is will produce the correct executables
(although larger).

The only changes done since 2003 was to remove 4 headers/includes, everything
else is just as we left it right around the compo deadlines.
The c2p will crunch slightly better (and possibly be a tad faster) if it is
unrolled, but that's left as an exercise for the reader.
